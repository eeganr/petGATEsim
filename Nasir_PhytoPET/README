To run the phyto PET simulations:

THE EDIT SECTIONS ARE ALL MARKED WITH ############### EDIT ################ IN 
	THE INDIVIDUAL FILES

1. Edit the file submit1.sh, see the comments there for what to change
2. Edit the file runtrain1.sh, see the comments throughout the file for what to 
	change
3. Edit the file simu_pet.mac to change data output format
4. To run the simulation (from the directory with all of the files):
	sbatch submit1.sh $index $source $duration $rotation

	- index is just a number which is added to the output files for id
	- source is the source. There are several sources in the sources directory.
		The ones labeled PS**.mac are point sources located in different places
		in the FOV
	- duration is the length of the simulation in seconds. 
		- If the source activity is too high,
		and the duration is too long, the time for simulation will exceed the 48hr
		limit. Let me know if using high activity or need lots of data
	- rotation is the Geometry file. 
		- Geometry.mac is PhytoPET scanner
		- Geometry11.25.mac is PhytoPET scanner rotated 11.25 degrees
		- Geometry22.5.mac is PhytoPET scanner rotated 22.5 degrees
		- etc

Ex) sbatch submit1.sh 1 sources/PS10.mac 30.0 Geometry.mac
